## Common Misconceptions About Leadpages

There are some common misconceptions about Leadpages that need clearing up. Let‚Äôs bust the myths:

- **Not a Website Builder**: Leadpages is a lead generation and landing page tool, not a full website builder. While it allows you to create custom landing pages, it complements your existing website rather than replacing it.
- **Not Only for Big Businesses**: Leadpages is designed for everyone. Small businesses can also leverage its tools to create professional, high-converting landing pages.
- **No Advanced Tech Skills Required**: With its drag-and-drop interface, anyone can use Leadpages without needing technical expertise.
- **Not a CRM or Website Host**: Leadpages helps capture leads but requires a CRM for managing and nurturing them. Additionally, you‚Äôll need a website host to publish your pages.

In short, Leadpages is a robust tool for lead capture and boosting conversions, but it‚Äôs not a one-size-fits-all solution. It‚Äôs best paired with other tools to meet all your online business needs.
