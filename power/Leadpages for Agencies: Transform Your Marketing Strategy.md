## Key Features of Leadpages

### LeadBoxes: Smart Popups for Engagement

LeadBoxes is a standout feature of Leadpages. These popups can be added to blogs, websites, or anywhere you need to capture leads. LeadBoxes can:

- Trigger popups when visitors click buttons, images, or text.
- Use timers to display popups after visitors spend a certain amount of time on your site.
- Feature "Exit LeadBoxes" to capture visitors as they prepare to leave your site.

These smart popups are a fantastic way to re-engage users and increase conversions.

### Native Ad Creation

Leadpages goes beyond landing pages by allowing you to create and launch Facebook and Instagram ads directly within the platform. With this feature, Leadpages automatically pulls content from your landing page, allowing you to edit and publish highly targeted ads. This integrated ad creation saves time and optimizes ad spend by ensuring consistent messaging across platforms.

### Split Testing

Split testing is essential for improving your conversion rates. Leadpages allows users to test multiple variations of their landing pages side-by-side. By comparing conversion rates, you can identify which elements work best and refine your campaigns for maximum effectiveness.

### Seamless Integrations
