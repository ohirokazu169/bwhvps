## What Not to Do When Building Landing Pages

Before diving into how to build effective landing pages, it‚Äôs essential to recognize the common mistakes many marketers and business owners make. Avoid these pitfalls:

- **Overthinking the Design**: You don‚Äôt need fancy tools like Photoshop or Figma to create a landing page. Instead, use simple drag-and-drop tools like Leadpages.  
- **Prioritizing Looks Over Functionality**: Conversion rate is the only metric that matters. A visually appealing page is meaningless if it doesn't convert visitors into leads or customers.  
- **Tweaking Too Early**: Publish a basic version of your landing page first. Collect data, then optimize based on performance.  

## Get Your Objectives Down First

Before you start building, clarify your **objectives**. A landing page is only as effective as its purpose. Ask yourself:

- What action do I want visitors to take? (E.g., sign up, purchase, request a demo.)
- Is the page part of a paid ad campaign or organic traffic strategy?
- Am I targeting lead generation, eCommerce sales, or email list growth?  

Having clear goals will help you craft a focused, high-converting landing page.

## Know Your Benchmarks and Competition

Setting realistic conversion goals requires knowing industry benchmarks. For example, **average landing page conversion rates vary by industry**‚Äîfrom 2% in eCommerce to over 10% in finance. Leverage tools like the Unbounce Conversion Benchmark Report to gain insights.

Additionally, analyze your competitors. Study their landing pages, ads, and email campaigns. Use tools like SimilarWeb and SpyFu to understand their strategies and adapt them for your business.

## Core Elements of High-Converting Landing Pages

### 1. Focus on Mobile-First Design

With over 6.8 billion smartphone users globally, designing **mobile-friendly landing pages** is non-negotiable. Ensure your page:

- Loads quickly (ideally under 3 seconds).  
- Has easy-to-click buttons and forms.  
- Features a clean layout for mobile screens.  

### 2. The ‚ÄúOne Action Per Page‚Äù Rule

Each landing page should focus on **one specific action**. For example, if you're offering a discount, the only call-to-action (CTA) should be something like ‚ÄúGet 20% Off Now.‚Äù Avoid distractions like social media buttons, additional navigation links, or multiple CTAs.

### 3. Add Videos for Higher Conversions

Studies show that landing pages with videos can boost conversions by over 34%. Use short, engaging videos to:

- Explain your product or service.
- Showcase testimonials.
- Highlight benefits in a visually appealing way.  

**Pro Tip**: Avoid autoplay videos with sound; they can irritate users.

### 4. Lead Forms Above the Fold

Place your lead capture form prominently, ideally above the fold. Keep it short and simple‚Äîask only for essential information like name and email. Long forms create friction and reduce conversions.

## Use AI Tools to Streamline Landing Page Creation

Many landing page builders, like Leadpages, now offer AI-driven features to simplify design and copywriting. AI tools can help:

- Generate persuasive headlines and CTAs.  
- Optimize page layouts based on user behavior.  
- Create personalized content at scale.  

By leveraging AI, you can save time and improve conversion rates.

## Landing Pages + Email = Conversion Gold

Landing pages are just one part of the equation. Pair them with **email marketing** to nurture leads and drive sales. Here‚Äôs how it works:

- After a visitor signs up, send an automated email delivering the promised content (e.g., a PDF or coupon).  
- Use follow-up emails to build trust and guide them toward a purchase.  

Email automation platforms like ConvertKit or Mailchimp can seamlessly integrate with your landing page tools.

## Conclusion

Building high-converting landing pages doesn‚Äôt have to be complicated. By focusing on clear objectives, mobile-first design, and data-driven optimization, you can create pages that drive real results. Start crafting your landing pages today with Leadpages and watch your conversions soar!
