## What Is an Evergreen Sales Funnel?

At its core, an evergreen sales funnel is an automated system designed to sell your products or services consistently, even while you sleep. Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. Someone discovers your business through your website or social media.
2. They sign up for a lead magnet (a free offer like a checklist or webinar).
3. They‚Äôre entered into a pre-planned email sequence that nurtures them and introduces them to your paid product or course.

It‚Äôs a **strategic process** that takes someone from being a complete stranger to a loyal customer without requiring ongoing, active effort. Once your funnel is set up, your focus shifts to driving traffic into the funnel and optimizing its performance for better conversion rates.

### Key Benefits of Evergreen Sales Funnels

- **Consistency**: Generate daily sales without live launches.
- **Automation**: Focus your energy on other tasks while your funnel does the heavy lifting.
- **Scalability**: Easily track performance and make data-driven optimizations.

### Why Every Business Needs an Evergreen Funnel

Evergreen sales funnels aren‚Äôt just about passive income‚Äîthey‚Äôre about creating a **predictable revenue stream** that supports your business even during unexpected life events. For example, when my fourth son was born and needed an extended NICU stay, my business continued generating income through these funnels. This allowed me to focus on my family while maintaining financial stability.
