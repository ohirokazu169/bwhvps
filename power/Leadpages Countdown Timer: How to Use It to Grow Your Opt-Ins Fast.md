## Step-by-Step Guide to Adding a Countdown Timer in Leadpages

### 1. Start by Logging In

To begin, log in to your **Leadpages** account and click on the **Landing Pages** tab from the left-hand side panel. You can either choose an existing landing page to edit or create a new one.

### 2. Locate the Countdown Timer Widget

Once you've selected the landing page you'd like to add the timer to:
- Click the pencil icon to open the **Leadpages Editor**.
- From the left-hand panel, click on **Widgets**, then scroll down to find the **Countdown Timer**.
- Drag and drop the timer widget to the desired location on your page.

### 3. Customize Your Countdown Timer

Hover over the countdown timer widget to reveal several options:

- **Duplicate or Move**: Easily create multiple instances of the timer or relocate it.
- **Delete the Timer**: Remove the timer widget if necessary.

#### Types of Countdown Timers
Under the **Date** section, select the type of countdown timer youâ€™d like to use:
1. **Standard Countdown Timer**: Counts down to a specific date and timeâ€”ideal for flash sales or promotional events.

- **Redirect Visitors**: Redirect them to another page, section, or external URL (e.g., a sales page with regular pricing after a flash sale).
- **Show/Hide Elements**: Decide which elements of the page to display or hide once the timer ends.

### 5. Style and Design the Countdown Timer

Customize the appearance of your countdown timer:
- **Colors**: Use your brand colors or input a custom color code.
