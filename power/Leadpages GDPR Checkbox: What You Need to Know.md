### LeadBoxes: Smarter Pop-Ups

Leadboxes are pop-ups designed to help you capture leads efficiently. These pop-ups can be strategically placed across your digital assets, such as blogs or personal websites. Features include:

- **Timed Pop-Ups**: Display a pop-up after a visitor spends a specific amount of time on your website.
- **Exit-Intent Pop-Ups**: Trigger a pop-up as a visitor is about to leave, giving them one last chance to engage.

These pop-ups are perfect for converting both organic and paid traffic into leads, ensuring no opportunity is wasted.

### Native Ad Creation

One standout feature of Leadpages is its ability to create Facebook and Instagram ads directly within the platform. This feature saves time and maximizes your ad spend by automating the ad creation process. Leadpages will pull content directly from your landing page, allowing you to edit as needed and launch a compelling ad that drives traffic. Additionally, Leadpages automatically integrates Facebook Pixel to provide advanced analytics and retargeting options.

### Built-In A/B Testing

A/B testing is a critical feature for improving conversion rates. Leadpages includes a powerful split-testing tool that allows you to compare different versions of your landing page. This data-driven approach helps you determine which design or content performs best, leading to more effective campaigns.
